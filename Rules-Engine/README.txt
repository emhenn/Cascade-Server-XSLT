Dynamic Asset Assignment with Rules Engines

This XSLT format will allow you to attach rules to assets in order to have them used by pages instead of having to make assignments at the region level of a page in order to have it consume a particular asset.

1. Metadata - Make a Metadata Set

Set Display Name to inline
Create a new text field called "rule" with a visible name of "Rule"

2. Asset Factory - Create an Asset Factory

Create a base file
Attach the Metadata to the file
Create an Asset Factory of type file that is set to use the base file 
and store the new files in /images/headers/ or another appropriate folder

3. Index Block - Create an Index Block

Create an index block that will index the /images/headers/ folder
index files
Indexed Asset Content (Regular Content, System Metadata, UserMetadata, Append Calling Page Data)

4. XSLT - Modify the XSLT

Change the output section of the template that has match="/"
so that it meets your needs

5. Template - Assign the Index Block and the XSLT Format to the right Template or Configuration Set

6. Image - Create some assets and Test
